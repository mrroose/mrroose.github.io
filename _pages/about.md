I'm a first year PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) supervised by [Jan-Willem van de Meent](https://jwvdm.github.io/). My PhD research focuses on causality and using Bayesian methods to infer underlying causal models from data. Previously, I wrote my Master's thesis on Autoencoders within Flows (AEFs) under the supervision of [Luca Ambrogioni](https://twitter.com/LucaAmb).

I graduated Cum Laude with a Master's in Computing Science from the [Radboud University Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/) with a specialization in Data Science.
