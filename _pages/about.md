I'm a first year PhD student at the [Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab](https://amlab.science.uva.nl/) supervised by [Jan-Willem van de Meent](https://jwvdm.github.io/) and [Sara Magliacane](https://saramagliacane.github.io/). As student in the [UvA-Bosch Delta Lab](https://ivi.fnwi.uva.nl/uvaboschdeltalab/) I am also supervised by [Sebastian Gerwinn](https://www.bosch-ai.com/research/researcher-pages/t_overviewpage_38.html). In general, I am interested in generative models, representation learning, and causality-inspired machine learning. Previously, I wrote my Master's thesis on Autoencoders within Flows (AEFs) under the supervision of [Luca Ambrogioni](https://twitter.com/LucaAmb).

I obtained a Master's degree in Computing Science from the [Radboud University Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/) with a specialization in Data Science.
